        {
          "slug": "birds",
          "name": "Birds"
        },
        {

          "name": "Cats"
        },
        {
          "slug": "dogs",
          "name": "Dogs"
        },
        {
          "slug": "fish",
          "name": "Fish"
        },
        {

          "name": "Horses"
        }
      ]
    },

  ]
}
```

### Response Fields

<ResponseField name="slug" type="string">
  The tag slug. Use this value in the `tags[]` filter parameter when filtering events.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="name" type="string">
  The human-readable tag name.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="children" type="array" optional={true}>
  Array of child tags (if this tag has children in the hierarchy). Each child follows the same structure with `slug`, `name`, and optionally `children`.
</ResponseField>

## Using Tags for Filtering

Once you have the list of tags, you can use the `slug` values to filter events on the `/today` and `/date` endpoints:

```bash
# Filter by a single tag
curl -H 'X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
  'https://www.daysoftheyear.com/api/v2/today/?tags[]=food'

# Filter by multiple tags (AND logic)
curl -H 'X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
  'https://www.daysoftheyear.com/api/v2/today/?tags[]=food&tags[]=beverage&filter_operator=and'

# Filter by multiple tags (OR logic)
curl -H 'X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
  'https://www.daysoftheyear.com/api/v2/today/?tags[]=food&tags[]=beverage&filter_operator=or'
```

<Warning>
Filtering by tags is only available for **Pro** and **Enterprise** tiers. Free tier requests with tag filters will be ignored.
</Warning>

## Hierarchical Structure

Tags are returned in a hierarchical structure, showing parent-child relationships. For example:

- **Animals** (parent)
  - Birds (child)
  - Cats (child)
  - Dogs (child)
  - Fish (child)
  - Horses (child)

When filtering, you can use either parent or child tag slugs. The API will match events that have the specified tag or any of its children.
