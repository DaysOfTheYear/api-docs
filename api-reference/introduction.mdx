## Welcome

The Days Of The Year API v2 provides programmatic access to our comprehensive database of holidays, observances, and special days. This API is designed with role-based access control, allowing different tiers of access based on your subscription level.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://www.daysoftheyear.com/api/v2
```

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using an API key. API keys are automatically generated when you create an account on Days Of The Year.

### Getting Your API Key

1. Create an account on [Days Of The Year](https://www.daysoftheyear.com)
2. Navigate to your profile's [Developer](https://www.daysoftheyear.com/account/developer/) section
3. Your API key will be displayed in the "API Key" field

<Warning>
Keep your API key secure and never expose it in client-side code or public repositories.
</Warning>

## API Roles & Access Levels

The v2 API uses role-based access control with three tiers:

### Free Tier
- **Endpoints**: `/today`, `/date`, `/event`
- **Date Range**: Up to **7** days into the future
- **Field Filtering**: Limited field filtering and response depth.
- **Automatically assigned** to all new users

<warning>
Free tier users must include attribution when displaying content from the API:

> "Powered by [Days Of The Year](https://www.daysoftheyear.com)"

This attribution message is included in every API response. By using the Days Of The Year API, you agree to these terms.
</warning>

### Pro Tier
- **Endpoints**: `/today`, `/date`, `/search`
- **Date Range**: Up to **90** days into the future
- **Full field access** on all endpoints

### Enterprise Tier
- **Endpoints**: `/today`, `/date`, `/search`
- **Date Range**: Up to **365** days into the future
- **Full field access** on all endpoints

## Caching

API responses are cached for performance. The `cache_status` field in the response meta indicates whether you received a cached response (`"HIT"`) or a fresh one (`"MISS"`). Cache duration is typically 1 hour.

## Rate Limiting

Rate limiting is applied per API key. Specific limits vary by tier. If you exceed your rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.
