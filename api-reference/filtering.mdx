## Overview

The Days Of The Year API v2 provides filtering capabilities for Pro and Enterprise tier users. Filtering allows you to narrow down event results based on multiple criteria, making it easier to find exactly the events you need.

<Note>
Filtering is **only available** for **Pro** and **Enterprise** tiers. Free tier users can include filter parameters in their requests, but they will be ignored (filters are not applied to the results).
</Note>

## Available Endpoints

Filtering is available on the following endpoints:
- `/v2/today` - Filter today's events
- `/v2/date/{date}` - Filter events for a specific date

<Note>
The `/v2/search` and `/v2/events` endpoints do not support API-level filtering. Use their built-in search capabilities instead.
</Note>

## Filter Parameters

  Filter events by date type. Must be one of: `"fixed"`, `"floating"`, or `"recurring"`.
  
  **Types:**
  - `fixed` - Events that occur on the same date every year (e.g., January 1st)
  - `floating` - Events that occur on a relative date (e.g., first Monday of January)
  - `recurring` - Events that occur multiple times per year
  
  **Example:** `date_type=fixed`
</ParamField>

**Use cases:**
- Find only fixed-date holidays for calendar planning

  **Example:** `event_type=day`
</ParamField>

**Use cases:**
- Show only day-specific events
- Filter for month-long awareness campaigns
- Separate different event classifications

## Filter Operator

The `filter_operator` parameter controls how multiple filter values are combined.

<ParamField body="filter_operator" type="string" required={false}>
  Operator for combining multiple filter values. Must be `"and"` or `"or"`. Defaults to `"and"`.
  
  - `"and"`: Event must match **ALL** specified filter values
  - `"or"`: Event must match **ANY** of the specified filter values
  
  **Example:** `filter_operator=or`
</ParamField>

### AND Operator (Default)

When `filter_operator=and` (or omitted), events must match **ALL** specified filter criteria:

- **Multiple tags**: Event must have **ALL** specified tags
- **Multiple NAICS codes**: Event must have **ALL** specified NAICS codes
- **Multiple countries**: Event must be observed in **ALL** specified countries
- **Multiple filter types**: Event must match **ALL** filter types (tags AND naics AND grade_min, etc.)

**Example:**
```
tags[]=food&tags[]=beverage&naics[]=311920&filter_operator=and
```

This returns events that have **both** tags (food AND beverage) **AND** the NAICS code 311920.

### OR Operator

When `filter_operator=or`, events must match **ANY** of the specified filter criteria:

- **Multiple tags**: Event must have **ANY** of the specified tags
- **Multiple NAICS codes**: Event must have **ANY** of the specified NAICS codes
- **Multiple countries**: Event must be observed in **ANY** of the specified countries
- **Multiple filter types**: Event must match **ANY** filter type (tags OR naics OR grade_min, etc.)

**Example:**
```
tags[]=food&tags[]=beverage&naics[]=311920&filter_operator=or
```

This returns events that have **either** tag (food OR beverage) **OR** the NAICS code 311920.

## Request Examples

### Basic Filtering (AND Logic)

Filter today's events to show only high-quality food-related events in the US:

```bash
curl -H 'X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
  'https://www.daysoftheyear.com/api/v2/today/?tags[]=food&grade_min=4&countries[]=US&filter_operator=and'
```

### Complex Filtering (OR Logic)

Find events that are either food-related OR beverage-related OR in the coffee industry:

```bash
curl -H 'X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
  'https://www.daysoftheyear.com/api/v2/today/?tags[]=food&tags[]=beverage&naics[]=311920&filter_operator=or'
```

### Date-Specific Filtering

Filter events for a specific date by multiple criteria:

```bash
curl -H 'X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
  'https://www.daysoftheyear.com/api/v2/date/2025/01/15/?tags[]=food&date_type=fixed&event_type=day&filter_operator=and'
```

### Combining Multiple Filter Types

Combine tags, NAICS codes, countries, and grade minimum:

```bash
curl -H 'X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
  'https://www.daysoftheyear.com/api/v2/today/?tags[]=food&naics[]=311920&countries[]=US&countries[]=CA&grade_min=4&filter_operator=and'
```

## Filtering Best Practices

### 1. Start Broad, Then Narrow

Begin with fewer filters to see what's available, then add more specific filters to narrow down results.

### 2. Use AND for Specific Results

Use `filter_operator=and` when you need events that match all your criteria (e.g., food-related events in the US with high quality).

### 3. Use OR for Broader Results

Use `filter_operator=or` when you want events that match any of your criteria (e.g., food OR beverage OR coffee industry events).

### 4. Combine Filter Types Strategically

- **Tags + Countries**: Find events relevant to specific topics in specific regions
- **NAICS + Grade**: Target industry-specific, high-quality events
- **Date Type + Event Type**: Filter for specific event patterns

### 5. Test Your Filters

Test filter combinations to ensure you're getting the expected results. Adjust `filter_operator` if results are too narrow or too broad.

## Common Filter Combinations

### High-Quality Food Events in North America

```bash
tags[]=food&grade_min=4&countries[]=US&countries[]=CA&filter_operator=and
```

### Technology Events (Any Quality)

```bash
tags[]=technology&filter_operator=or
```

### Fixed-Date Holidays in Multiple Countries

```bash
date_type=fixed&event_type=day&countries[]=US&countries[]=GB&countries[]=AU&filter_operator=and
```

### Coffee Industry Events (High Quality)

```bash
naics[]=311920&grade_min=4&filter_operator=and
```

## Limitations

- Filtering is only available for **Pro** and **Enterprise** tiers
- Free tier requests with filter parameters will be ignored (no error, but filters won't be applied)
- Filtering is not available on `/v2/search` or `/v2/events` endpoints
- Maximum filter values per parameter are subject to API limits

## Error Handling

If you provide invalid filter values, you'll receive a `400 Bad Request` response:

```json
{
  "code": 400,
  "message": "Invalid parameter(s): grade_min",
  "data": []
}
```

Common errors:
- Invalid `grade_min` value (must be a valid integer)
- Invalid `date_type` value (must be "fixed", "floating", or "recurring")
- Invalid `event_type` value (must be "day", "month", or "other")
- Invalid `filter_operator` value (must be "and" or "or")
