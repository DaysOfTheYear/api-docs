## Overview

The Days Of The Year API v2 uses role-based access control with three distinct tiers. Each tier provides different levels of access to endpoints, date ranges, and data fields.

## Role Tiers

### Free Tier

**Automatically assigned** to all new users upon account creation.

#### Endpoint Access
- ✅ `/today` - Get today's events
- ❌ `/date` - Get events by date
- ❌ `/search` - Not available
- ❌ `/events` - Not available

#### Date Range Limits
- **Maximum future date range**: Today only

#### Filtering
- ❌ **API-level filtering not available**
- Filter parameters in requests are ignored (not applied to results)

<Note>
Free tier users can still access all events, but cannot filter results using query parameters. To use filtering, upgrade to Pro or Enterprise tier.
</Note>

#### Use Cases
- Personal projects
- Small applications
- Testing and development
- Educational purposes

## Attribution Requirements

### Free Tier

Free tier users **must** include attribution when displaying content from the API:

> "Powered by [Days Of The Year](https://www.daysoftheyear.com)"

The attribution should be in hyperlink format:

```html
Powered by <a title="Days Of The Year" href="https://www.daysoftheyear.com">Days Of The Year</a>.
```

### Pro and Enterprise Tiers

**Attribution is not required** for Pro and Enterprise tier users. You may use API content without displaying attribution.

<Note>
The attribution message is included in every API response for reference, but only Free tier users are required to display it.
</Note>

## Checking Your Tier

You can check your current API tier and capabilities using the `/v2/tier` endpoint. This endpoint returns information about your tier, endpoint access, date range limits, and filtering capabilities.

### Using the Tier Endpoint

```bash
curl -H 'X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
  'https://www.daysoftheyear.com/api/v2/tier/'
```

**Response example:**

```json
{
  "code": 200,
  "message": "Tier information retrieved successfully",
  "data": {
    "tier": "pro",
    "role": "api_user_pro",
    "endpoint_access": {
      "today": true,
      "date": true,
      "search": true,
      "events": true
    },
    "max_date_range": 90,
    "can_filter": true,
    "attribution_required": false
  }
}
```

<Info>
For complete documentation on the tier endpoint, including all response fields, see the [Tier Endpoint](/api-reference/endpoints/reference/tier) page.

### Access Denied Responses

If you attempt to access an endpoint not available to your tier, you'll receive a `403 Forbidden` response:

```json
{
  "code": 403,
  "message": "Sorry, you are not allowed to access this endpoint."
}
```
