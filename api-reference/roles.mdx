## Checking Your Tier

Your API tier determines which endpoints you can access. If you attempt to access an endpoint not available to your tier, you'll receive a `403 Forbidden` response:

```json
{
  "code": 403,
  "message": "Sorry, you are not allowed to access this endpoint."
}
```

## Attribution Requirements

Free tier users must include attribution when displaying content from the API:

> "Powered by [Days Of The Year](https://www.daysoftheyear.com)"

This attribution message is included in every API response for reference.
