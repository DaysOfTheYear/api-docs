## Overview

The Days Of The Year API v2 uses role-based access control with three distinct tiers. Each tier provides different levels of access to endpoints, date ranges, and data fields.

- ❌ `/search` - Not available
- ❌ `/events` - Not available

#### Date Range Limits

- **Past dates**: Unlimited

#### Field Filtering
- On `/today` endpoint: `naics` and `content` fields are **removed** from responses

## Checking Your Tier

Your API tier determines which endpoints you can access. If you attempt to access an endpoint not available to your tier, you'll receive a `403 Forbidden` response:

```json
{
  "code": 403,
  "message": "Sorry, you are not allowed to access this endpoint."
}
```
