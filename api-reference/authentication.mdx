## Overview

All API requests require authentication using an API key. API keys are automatically generated when you create an account.

## Getting Your API Key

When you create a new account on Days Of The Year, an API key is automatically generated and assigned to your account. You don't need to request access—it's available immediately.

### Finding Your API Key

1. [Log in to your Days Of The Year account](https://www.daysoftheyear.com/login) (or [register](https://www.daysoftheyear.com/join) if you don't have an account - it's free!)
2. Navigate to the [Developer section](https://www.daysoftheyear.com/account/developer/) in your account
3. Your API key (labeled as "API Key") will be displayed

<Note>
Your API key is unique to your account and should be kept secure. If you suspect your key has been compromised, contact support to regenerate it.
</Note>

## Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the `X-Api-Key` header with every API request.

### cURL Example

```bash
curl -H 'X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
  'https://www.daysoftheyear.com/api/v2/today/'
```

### JavaScript (Fetch) Example

```javascript
fetch('https://www.daysoftheyear.com/api/v2/today/', {
  headers: {
    'X-Api-Key': 'YOUR_API_KEY'
  }
})
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data));
```

### Python Example

```python
import requests

headers = {
    'X-Api-Key': 'YOUR_API_KEY'
}

response = requests.get(
    'https://www.daysoftheyear.com/api/v2/today/',
    headers=headers
)

data = response.json()
print(data)
```

### PHP Example

```php
$ch = curl_init('https://www.daysoftheyear.com/api/v2/today/');
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, [
    'X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY'
]);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
$response = curl_exec($ch);
$data = json_decode($response, true);
curl_close($ch);
```

## Authentication Errors

### Missing API Key

If you don't include the `X-Api-Key` header, you'll receive a `401 Unauthorized` response:

```json
{
  "code": 401,
  "message": "Authentication required"
}
```

### Invalid API Key

If your API key is invalid or has been revoked, you'll receive a `401 Unauthorized` response:

```json
{
  "code": 401,
  "message": "Invalid API key"
}
```

## API Key Format

API keys are MD5 hashes (32-character hexadecimal strings). Example format:

## Key Regeneration

If you need to regenerate your API key, please contact support. Regenerating a key will invalidate the previous key immediately.
