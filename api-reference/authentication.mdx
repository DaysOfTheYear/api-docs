## Overview

All API requests require authentication using an API key. API keys are automatically generated when you create an account.

## Getting Your API Key

### Automatic Generation

When you create a new account on Days Of The Year, an API key is automatically generated and assigned to your account. You don't need to request access—it's available immediately.

### Finding Your API Key

  <Card
    title="Find Your API Key"
    icon="key"
    href="https://www.daysoftheyear.com/account/developer/"
  >
    Access your API Key on your Developer area.
  </Card>

1. Log in to your Days Of The Year account
2. Navigate to your profile page
3. Click on the "Developer" section
4. Your API key (labeled as "API Key") will be displayed

<Note>
Your API key is unique to your account and should be kept secure. If you suspect your key has been compromised, contact support to regenerate it.
</Note>

## Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the `X-Api-Key` header with every API request.

### cURL Example

```bash
curl -H 'X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
  'https://www.daysoftheyear.com/api/v2/today/'
```

### JavaScript (Fetch) Example

```javascript
fetch('https://www.daysoftheyear.com/api/v2/today/', {
  headers: {
    'X-Api-Key': 'YOUR_API_KEY'
  }
})
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data));
```

### Python Example

```python
import requests

headers = {
    'X-Api-Key': 'YOUR_API_KEY'
}

response = requests.get(
    'https://www.daysoftheyear.com/api/v2/today/',
    headers=headers
)

data = response.json()
print(data)
```

### PHP Example

```php
$ch = curl_init('https://www.daysoftheyear.com/api/v2/today/');
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, [
    'X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY'
]);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
$response = curl_exec($ch);
$data = json_decode($response, true);
curl_close($ch);
```

## Authentication Errors

### Missing API Key

If you don't include the `X-Api-Key` header, you'll receive a `401 Unauthorized` response:

```json
{
  "code": 401,
  "message": "Authentication required"
}
```

### Invalid API Key

If your API key is invalid or has been revoked, you'll receive a `401 Unauthorized` response:

```json
{
  "code": 401,
  "message": "Invalid API key"
}
```

## Key Regeneration

If you need to regenerate your API key, contact support. Regenerating a key will invalidate the previous key immediately.
