## Welcome

The Days Of The Year API v2 provides programmatic access to our comprehensive database of holidays, observances, and special days. This API is designed with role-based access control, allowing different tiers of access based on your subscription level.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://www.daysoftheyear.com/api/v2
```

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using an API key. API keys are automatically generated when you create an account on Days Of The Year.

### Getting Your API Key

1. Create an account on [Days Of The Year](https://www.daysoftheyear.com)
2. Navigate to your profile's Developer section
3. Your API key will be displayed in the "Secret key" field

### Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the `X-Api-Key` header with every request:

```bash
curl -H 'X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
  'https://www.daysoftheyear.com/api/v2/today/'
```

<Warning>
Keep your API key secure and never expose it in client-side code or public repositories.
</Warning>

## Response Format

All API responses follow a consistent JSON structure:

```json
{
  "code": 200,
  "meta": {
    "cache_status": "MISS",
    "response_count": 5,
    "request_type": "TODAY"
  },
  "message": "Please remember; your free use of this API requires full attribution...",
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 12345,
      "name": "National Coffee Day",
      "url": "https://www.daysoftheyear.com/days/coffee-day/",
      "excerpt": "A celebration of coffee...",
      "type": "day",
      "next_date": "2025-01-15",
      "grade": 5,
      "tags": ["food", "beverage"],
      "countries": ["US", "CA"],
      "date_type": "fixed",
      "date_pattern": "YYYY-MM-DD"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Response Fields

- `code` (integer): HTTP status code
- `meta` (object): Response metadata
  - `cache_status` (string): `"HIT"` or `"MISS"` indicating cache status
  - `response_count` (integer): Number of events returned
  - `request_type` (string): Type of request (`"TODAY"`, `"DATE"`, `"SEARCH"`, `"EVENTS"`)
- `message` (string): Attribution message (required for free tier usage)
- `data` (array): Array of event objects

## Caching

API responses are cached for performance. The `cache_status` field in the response meta indicates whether you received a cached response (`"HIT"`) or a fresh one (`"MISS"`). Cache duration is typically 1 hour.

<Note>
We recommend caching responses locally in your application. Values refresh every hour, and results are sorted by our internal editorial grading values, then by type (day > month > other).
</Note>

## Rate Limiting

Rate limiting is applied per API key. Specific limits vary by tier. If you exceed your rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

## Error Responses

The API uses standard HTTP status codes:

- `200 OK`: Request successful
- `400 Bad Request`: Invalid request parameters
- `401 Unauthorized`: Missing or invalid API key
- `403 Forbidden`: Access denied (endpoint not available for your tier)
- `404 Not Found`: Endpoint or resource not found
- `429 Too Many Requests`: Rate limit exceeded
- `500 Internal Server Error`: Server error

Error responses include a `message` field with details:

```json
{
  "code": 400,
  "message": "Date range exceeded. Maximum allowed: 7 days into the future.",
  "data": [],
  "meta": {
    "error_code": "date_range_exceeded",
    "request_type": "DATE"
  }
}
```

## Filtering

Pro and Enterprise tier users can use advanced filtering capabilities to narrow down event results. Filter by tags, NAICS codes, countries, grade, date type, and event type using AND/OR logic.

<Info>
For comprehensive filtering documentation, see the [Filtering Guide](/api-reference/filtering).

## Attribution

### Free Tier

Free tier users **must** include attribution when displaying content from the API:

> "Powered by [Days Of The Year](https://www.daysoftheyear.com)"

### Pro and Enterprise Tiers

**Attribution is not required** for Pro and Enterprise tier users. You may use API content without displaying attribution.

<Note>
The attribution message is included in every API response for reference, but only Free tier users are required to display it.
