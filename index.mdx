## Welcome

The Days Of The Year API v2 provides programmatic access to our comprehensive database of holidays, observances, and special days. This API is designed with role-based access control, allowing different tiers of access based on your subscription level.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://www.daysoftheyear.com/api/v2
```

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using an API key. API keys are automatically generated when you create an account on Days Of The Year.

### Getting Your API Key

1. Create an account on [Days Of The Year](https://www.daysoftheyear.com)
2. Navigate to your profile's Developer section
3. Your API key will be displayed in the "Secret key" field

### Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the `X-Api-Key` header with every request:

```bash
curl -H 'X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
  'https://www.daysoftheyear.com/api/v2/today/'
```

<Warning>
Keep your API key secure and never expose it in client-side code or public repositories.
</Warning>

## Access Levels

The API v2 uses role-based access control with three tiers: Free, Pro, and Enterprise. Each tier provides different levels of access to endpoints, date ranges, and features.
